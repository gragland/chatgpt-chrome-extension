# ChatGPT Everywhere 🤖⚡️

A Chrome extension that adds ChatGPT to every text box on the internet! Use it to write tweets, revise emails, fix coding bugs, or whatever else you need, all without leaving the site you're on. Includes a plugin system for greater control over ChatGPT behavior and ability to interact with 3rd party APIs.

## Install

First clone this repo on your local machine

Then install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the server, so the extension can communicate with ChatGPT. This uses [chatgpt-api](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api/tree/main/src) and headless Chrome, but we can hopefully remove the need for this in the future.

```bash
node server.js
```

Add the extension

1. Go to chrome://extensions in your Google Chrome browser
2. Check the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner
3. Click "Load Unpacked" to see a file-selection dialog
4. Select your local `ask-chatgpt/extension` directory

You'll now see "Ask ChatGPT" if you right click in any text input or content edible area.

## Plugins

Plugins have the ability to inform ChatGPT of specific conversation rules and parse replies from ChatGPT before they are sent to the browser.

👩‍🏫 [Default](/plugins/Default.js) - Sets some default conversation rules

🖼️ [Image](/plugins/Image.js) - Tells ChatGPT to describe things visually when asked for an image and then replaces the description with a matching AI generated image from [Lexica](http://lexica.art)
